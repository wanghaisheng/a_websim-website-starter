## Tips for Writing Good Requirements

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Use active voice and specific language
- ‚úÖ Focus on what the system should do, not how
- ‚úÖ Make each requirement testable and verifiable
- ‚úÖ Include both positive and negative scenarios
- ‚úÖ Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't use vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
- ‚ùå Don't combine multiple requirements in one statement
- ‚ùå Don't specify implementation details
- ‚ùå Don't use subjective or unmeasurable criteria
- ‚ùå Don't forget to consider non-functional aspects

### Common EARS Patterns

**Event-Driven (WHEN)**
- User actions: "WHEN user clicks submit button"
- System events: "WHEN data sync completes"
- Time-based: "WHEN daily backup runs"

**Condition-Based (IF)**
- State checks: "IF user is authenticated"
- Data validation: "IF input is invalid"
- Permission checks: "IF user has admin role"

**Continuous (WHILE)**
- Ongoing processes: "WHILE file is uploading"
- Monitoring: "WHILE system is running"
- Real-time updates: "WHILE user is typing"

**Contextual (WHERE)**
- Platform-specific: "WHERE application runs on mobile"
- Environment-specific: "WHERE system is in production"
- Location-specific: "WHERE user is in restricted area"

- Ensure all requirements are covered by tasks
- Validate task completion against requirements

### Testing Integration

Every implementation task should include testing:
- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions

## Design Patterns Reference

### Common Patterns to Consider

**Creational Patterns**:
- Factory: When you need to create objects without specifying exact classes
- Builder: When constructing complex objects step by step
- Singleton: When you need exactly one instance of a class

**Structural Patterns**:
- Adapter: When integrating incompatible interfaces
- Decorator: When adding behavior without altering structure
- Facade: When simplifying complex subsystem interfaces

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Observer: When objects need to be notified of state changes
- Strategy: When you need to switch between algorithms
- Command: When you need to parameterize objects with operations

**Architectural Patterns**:
- MVC/MVP/MVVM: For separating presentation from business logic
- Repository: For abstracting data access logic
- Unit of Work: For maintaining consistency across multiple operations
